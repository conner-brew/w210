                <h1>About This Project</h1>
                <p>Surveys of child welfare practitioners in the foster care space identified the prevention of abuse and neglect of foster children as a key area for research. In the state of Virginia alone, child welfare practitioners receive nearly 38,000
                    reports of child abuse a year. Of those 38,000, roughly 10,000 investigations are conducted. Of those 10,000, roughly 3,000 are founded investigations. This means that out of 38,000 reports, there is only a 7.8% ratio of founded investigations.
                </p>
                <p>The availability of data related to foster cases enables our team to develop a trend analysis dashboard and triaging model to aid child welfare practitioners in analysing trends and risk factors associated with abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    </strong>Our team will use public AFCARS data to visualize trends associated with abuse and neglect in foster cases at the national and state level, in addition to the development of a tree-based classification model for approximated triaging
                    of foster cases in a sandbox environment.</p>
                <p>
                    </strong> The goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use educational tool that increases the ratio of founded investigations into physical and sexual abuse in the foster care system. </p>

                <h2>About Our Data</h2>
                <p>Each year, states send reports of Foster Care case data to the Adoption and Foster Care Reporting System (AFCARS). This data is then anonymized (all personally identifying information dropped or masked) and made available for public use,
                    upon request. Our team analyzed data from 50 states from 2000 - 2020, which consisted of over 15 million records and 71 variables. For our final product, we focused on the states of Virginia and California as a proof-of-concept project.</p>
